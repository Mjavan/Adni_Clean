    "Short answer: **just fine-tuning on two groups and then doing label-based saliency (backprop of a class logit) is *not* novel** on its own. That’s a very standard pipeline (train 2-class model → Grad-CAM/IG on the positive class). Reviewers will ask: *what’s new beyond applying known XAI to a new dataset?*\n",
    "\n",
    "You *can* make it into a publishable contribution by adding one (or more) of these **novelty levers**:\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to turn it into something new\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Group-level explainability (not just per-sample)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Backprop a **group statistic** (e.g., (T^2=|\\mu_A-\\mu_B|^2)) or a **contrastive margin** rather than a single logit.\n",
    "   * Show **quantitative curves**: corruption level ↑ ⇒ statistic ↑, IoU/pointing with known mask ↑, ΔT(top-q) − ΔT(random) ↑.\n",
    "   * This moves you beyond “pretty maps” into **population differences**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Artifact-free positive controls (methodological contribution)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Replace zero-out with your **smooth blur/attenuation** control and **prove** CAM/IG recover the injected signal monotonically.\n",
    "   * Package this as a **recommended sanity protocol** for medical XAI. (Most papers still use zeroing—this is a useful fix.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ROI-anchored validation (clinical meaning)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Quantify **% attribution inside hippocampus/temporal ROIs**, **pointing rate to ROI**, and **ΔT when masking ROI vs random** on ADNI.\n",
    "   * If AD maps consistently load on known anatomy, that’s meaningful (even if the model is simple).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Method agreement & faithfulness**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Compare **Grad-CAM/Grad-CAM++/IG/occlusion** on both control and ADNI.\n",
    "   * Report **agreement metrics** (Spearman on pixel importances, top-q IoU) and **which method best predicts ΔT** (faithfulness).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Probe vs end-to-end**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Show that a **frozen encoder + linear probe** yields **more stable/faithful attributions** than end-to-end fine-tuning (less overfit, better ΔT/ROI metrics).\n",
    "   * That’s a practical takeaway for the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Uncertainty-aware explanations (if you have it)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If your background includes Bayesian DL: relate **predictive uncertainty** to **attribution stability** (e.g., maps are unstable when uncertainty high). Even a small analysis here is interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimal publishable package (what to actually do)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Train: frozen encoder + **linear probe** for A vs B.\n",
    "* Controls: run your **blur/attenuation** positive control with 3 strengths; show **statistic↑, IoU↑, ΔT↑**.\n",
    "* Methods: Grad-CAM++ and **IG (+SmoothGrad)**.\n",
    "* ADNI: compute **energy-in-ROI**, **pointing@ROI**, **ΔT(top-q ROI) vs random** on confident correct cases.\n",
    "* Report **agreement** between methods and which best predicts ΔT.\n",
    "* 6–8 clear figures + 2 tables → workshop/journal short paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bottom line\n",
    "\n",
    "* **“Fine-tune + saliency” alone → not novel.**\n",
    "* **Add**: positive-control protocol + group-level/ROI metrics + method comparison tied to ΔT → **becomes a real contribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you tell me which of these levers you’re willing to include (e.g., positive control + ROI metrics), I’ll outline the exact figures and results section headings so you can assemble a tidy 4–6 week paper plan.\n"
